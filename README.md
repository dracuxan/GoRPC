# GoRPC

GoRPC is a demonstration project that showcases the implementation of microservices using the Go programming language and gRPC for efficient communication between services. This repository serves as a practical guide for developers looking to understand and build scalable microservices architectures.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Learn how to structure applications into independent, scalable services.
- **gRPC Integration**: Utilize gRPC for high-performance communication between services.
- **Go Language**: Leverage the simplicity and efficiency of Go for building robust microservices.
- **Example Implementations**: Explore example code that illustrates core concepts and best practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- Protocol Buffers (protoc)
- gRPC Go library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dracuxan/GoRPC.git
   cd GoRPC
   ```

2. Install the required Go packages:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Install Protocol Buffers and gRPC:

   Follow the instructions in the [gRPC Go documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/) to set up your environment.

### Running the Services

1. Build the gRPC server:

   ```bash
   go build -o server ./server
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   ./server
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, build and run the client:

   ```bash
   go build -o client ./client
   ./client
   ```

### Example Usage

Once the server and client are running, you can interact with the services as defined in the example implementations. Check the code for specific endpoints and functionalities.
